This arrangement is commonly utilized when a borrower or project is experiencing financial difficulties and requires additional breathing room to fulfill their obligations. The interest waiver provides immediate relief by reducing the interest expense, thereby easing the financial burden on the borrower. Simultaneously, the extension of the loan or project timeline allows for an extended repayment period, giving the borrower more time to recover financially and meet their obligations. The combination of interest waiver and extension aims to provide a temporary respite, enabling the borrower or project to regain stability and work towards long-term financial sustainability. This arrangement can be beneficial for both the borrower and the lender or investor, as it supports the borrower's financial recovery while maintaining a positive relationship and increasing the likelihood of successful loan repayment or project completion.",

This arrangement is typically implemented when a borrower or project is facing significant financial challenges and requires substantial support to overcome their financial difficulties. By waiving or reducing both the interest and principal, the borrower's debt burden is significantly alleviated, providing immediate relief and improving their cash flow position. Furthermore, the extension of the loan or project timeline offers additional time to repay the remaining debt and fulfill contractual obligations. This combined approach aims to provide a holistic solution, allowing the borrower or project to regain financial stability and work towards long-term sustainability. It also fosters a positive relationship between the borrower and lender or investor by demonstrating support and flexibility during challenging times. The interest plus principal waiver and extension provide a valuable opportunity for the borrower or project to restructure and recover, ultimately increasing the likelihood of successful debt repayment or project completion.",
